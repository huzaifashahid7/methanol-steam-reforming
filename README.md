## 🔬 Abstract

This research focuses on methanol steam reforming as an effective route for sustainable hydrogen production. The project investigates the role of zirconium-supported mesoporous silica (Zr-HMS) as a novel catalyst to enhance the performance of reforming reactions and simultaneously improve the cetane number of resulting fuels. The study is aligned with clean energy objectives and industrial emission control.
